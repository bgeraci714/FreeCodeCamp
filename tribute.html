                  Grace Hopper was a remarkable woman who rose to the challenges of early programming with the first available computers. She was known for inventing the first compiler for a programming language. She was also responsible for popularizing the idea of machine-independent programming, which eventually lead to the inception of COBOL. She is also noted for one of the first instances of "debugging" after finding a moth stuck in a relay of the Mark II computer.
